Interpretive Data

11:

eGFR

12:

The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated
using the 2020-12-20 CKD-EPI eGFR creatinine equation, which does not
include race as a factor. This equation is validated in
individuals 18 years of age and older.

Glucose Level

If this specimen was collected from a fasting patient, values of 100-125 mg/dL are considered impaired fasting
glucose/"prediabetes", according to current ADA guidelines.
