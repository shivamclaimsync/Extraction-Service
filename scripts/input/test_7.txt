[DATE]57-year-old super morbidly obese presenting to the emergency department by EMS
with concern for head injury and neck pain. She was trying to use the bathroom, she
bent over to move a container that was in the way and when she did she hit her head on
the bathroom counter in front of her. When she stood up she got dizzy and nearly fell
down but she sat on the commode instead of falling down on the ground. She did not
present on the commode, then went to stand up again and got a little bit dizzy, starting
to fall forward and she believes she hit her head again on the counter. She denies loss
of consciousness but does complain of persistent dizziness, little bit of tinnitus, mild
nausea and diffuse bilateral paraspinal neck pain. She denies any extremity injuries.
Patient is actually lost about 70 pounds since I last saw her, she is feeling well
otherwise and making progress.
