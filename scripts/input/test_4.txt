Medical Decision Making

[NAME_3] is a 57-year-old female who suffers from chronic respiratory failure secondary to
COPD. The patient lost power and her concentrator was not working. She tried to
switch to portable oxygen tank however her oxygen dropped. The patient felt confused.
There was reported the patient might have been unresponsive but when EMS arrived
the patient was awake and alert. She was placed on oxygen with improvement of her
symptoms. By the time the patient arrived to the [NAME_5] she was at her baseline. Patient
was afebrile 36.5 heart rate 79 blood pressure 130/98 and saturating 94% on 3 [NAME_6] EKG is reassuring. Chest x-ray was repeated and came back consistent with
her chronic changes without any acute abnormalities.

The patient will not have power at home until noon. I allowed the patient to stay in the
ED for observation and oxygen supplementation until she can be discharged home
safely. The patient will be signed out to Dr. [NAME_7] pending her dispo.
