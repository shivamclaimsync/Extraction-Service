Chief Complaint

1 week post fall follow up

History Of Present Illness
She tells me that she has not had any further falls.

She states last night when she was sleeping, her husband heard some rattling in her chest while she was breathing.
She said her husband wanted to send her to the hospital, but she did not want to go because she was being seen at
[LOCATION] today. She states her oxygen has been running low and she has had more shortness of breath. She has been
more tired the past few days. She has not been wearing her oxygen much at all during the day.

She states that she has 3 more mud bog races, but she is not going to do them, someone else is going to. She
states the extra money from the races was nice, but not worth her feeling so awful after words. She states her MS
does cause her pretty much constant pain. She says that last week when she got the higher dose of Toradol when
she left the clinic, and that it lasted her until the following afternoon. She has had more stress. States she switched
from dark colored pop to clear pop, still drinks lots of water but does not overdo it. Does not feel she has a UTI,
recommend she drink more water.
