Ppt tells me that she is a mud bog racer and has a mud bog truck that she drives. Her previous husband built her a
specialty stair assembly for her to get in and out of the truck. She has "new guy on my team" who did not think she
wipe off the stairs for her after she went through the mud so the stairs were wet/muddy and she slipped coming
down out of the truck. She tells me she did not injure herself and the only thing it hurt was her pride. She said they
have told the new [NAME_2] that the stairs have to be dry when she gets out of the truck and that she is agreeable for
some grip strips to be applied to the stairs.

She states she is not sure why but she ran out of her medications for almost 2 weeks. She states she has not had
pain medications, and that the past few days have been hard as she has had increased pain. She tells me she
usually gets a Toradol injection before she leaves PACE as the bus ride home is very jarring, but she is in so much
pain today that she is not sure if it will really help. We talked about a higher dose injection just for today and she is
agreeable to that.

Physical Examination
