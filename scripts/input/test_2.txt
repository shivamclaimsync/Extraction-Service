[NAME_3] is seen this afternoon following a fall earlier this morning in her home. She states that she got up and was
walking to the bathroom when her legs became entangled with her husband's oxygen tubing. She was able to get
out of this without injury although as she continued her route, her legs got tangled again and some unevenness on
the floor altered her step and walker which caused her to fall onto her left side. She has some pain in her left knee.
She also hit the left temple. She denies loss of consciousness. She frustrated with her brother-in-law who lives in
the home as she feels that he may have intentionally placed the oxygen tubing in her path.

On an unrelated note, she wonders if there are any options in regards to weight loss for her. She is discouraged
with her weight of 400 pounds today. She remains on torsemide with stable renal function and unfortunately when
torsemide was increased during her facility stay, her renal function worsen. She states she has been on Ozempic
past which she tolerated. She was not using this for diabetes, but rather for weight loss. She states that she is
trying to become more aware of her diet and caloric intake as well.

Physical Examination

[NAME_3] is alert and conversant. She is pleasant and in no acute distress. Head is normocephalic and atraumatic. I do
not see any bruising of the left temple or any area of the face. Heart is regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation with
nonlabored respirations at rest. Extremities reveal mild tenderness to palpation of the left knee. I do not see any
significant bruising, abrasion or other signs of trauma. Her legs are large from lymphedema so mild effusion is
difficult to assess for.

* Mechanical fall over oxygen tubing and uneven floor without injury. No indication for further imaging at this point.
Discussed trying to be aware of her and her husband's oxygen tubing.

(3) Morbid obesity -Y 22 278.01/E66.01

* BMI >60. Has used Wegovy/Ozempic in the past. Dietician to assist. Can discuss possible weight management program
in conjunction with dietician and clinic. She definitely would benefit from weight loss although I explained that medications
might allow more acute loss, the dietary changes are going to give the greatest long-term benefit.
